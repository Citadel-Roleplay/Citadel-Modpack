They conjured up the finest loaves and tarts; all under the judging stern eyes of renowned local baker, [GetTitleByKey('b_white_harbor').GetNameNoTier]'s own Poul Woodholly. Lord Manderly himself participated as a judge, and tasted every last pasty and pastry. At last a worthy winner was chosen, a #bold STAR BAKER#!.\n\nThis year the title went to a young lad from a small hamlet. The crowd cheered as the winner was presented, and every man, woman and child present shouted:\n\n"#italic DA STAR BAKER IN DA NORF! DA STAR BAKER IN DA NORF!#!"\n\nContent, and with  a full belly, you return to [GetTitleByKey('b_new_castle').GetNameNoTier], already looking forward to the next Great Northern Bake Off."
