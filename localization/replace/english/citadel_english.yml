BANEFORT_THE_HOODED_KINGS_NO_BULLETTAB:0 "The Baneforts were petty First Men kings of the Age of Heroes, claiming descent from the Hooded Man, a terrifying necromancer-king hailing from the Westerlands."
BANEFORT_BLACK_DUNGEONS_OF_THE_FORT:0 "It is said that in the deepest dungeons of the Banefort, the Hooded kings of old practiced powerful necromantic spells to raise the dead and use them as soldiers. Whether those rumours are true, or the dungeons are merely torture chambers; it is known only to the lords of the Banefort.\n#weak Some Baneforts tend to become [GetTrait('sadistic').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]."
BANEFORT_WELCOME_THE_GUESTS:0 "Despite their ominous appearance, House Banefort's words are 'Welcome Stranger'. Guest rights are highly respected and honoured under their roof, and peace banners are revered and adhered to.\n#weak Some Baneforts tend to become [GetTrait('gregarious').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]."
BANEFORT_MARCHERS_OF_IRONMAN_BAY:0 "House Banefort have fought off Ironborn reavers for centuries. While they possess no impressive naval presence, the Baneforts have thrown the Ironborn back to the sea many times. Many Ironborn have also found themselves unfortunate enough to land in the Banefort dungeons."
BANEFORT_SHADOW_KINGS_ONCE_MORE:0 "We have overthrown our petty overlords and now, under our hood, the realm is covered in prosperous shadow. Kings once more, both terrible and glorious. All who live beneath us shall serve loyally, or be consumed by the man beneath the hood."

CARGYLL_THE_GOLDEN_GOOSE:0 "According to legend, the legendary Golden Goose was the one who first brought eggs to Westeros."
CARGYLL_KNIGHTS_OF_HONOR_AND_DUTY:0 "House Cargyll has produced many exemplary knights and warriors. Though their lands are small, their prowess is revered and their loyalty is well-known. Knights of the Kingsguard such as Ser [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('Cargyll_12').GetFirstName] and Ser [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('Cargyll_11').GetFirstName] Cargyll stand as the greatest of examples of such prowess.\n#weak Some Cargylls tend to become [GetTrait('loyal').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]"
CARGYLL_GOOD_MEAD_FOR_A_GOOD_FLOCK:0 "It's not always war and struggle. The ancestral Cargyll seat of [GetTitleByKey('c_strongmead').GetNameNoTier] is well renowned for its production of strong meads. Such mead rivals even the dark ale of Aleport or the sharp cider of Cider Hall."
CARGYLL_GOLDEN_LOYALTY_GOLDEN_DUTY:0 "We are the Cargylls. That name carries great weight. Those of small stature yet those who cast a large shadow.

frey_legacy_5_name: "Plans Of Our Own"

FREY_FAMILY_MATTERS:0 "House Frey is an incredibly young house by Riverlander standards, especially amongst those of the Green Fork. Their explosive rise to prominence is largely due to their immense familial cooperation, making use of the combined brainpower and manpower of their entire dynasty. This reputation has become synonymous with notions of fertility.\n#weak Some Freys tend to become [GetTrait('fecund').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]"
FREY_SO_CALLED_UPSTARTS:0 "House Frey's relevantly recent rise to such lordly stature has made them very unpopular amongst the Westerosi highborn. If anything however, this acridity serves only to motivate the scions of House Frey, whose lofty ambitions bring them from one machination to another.\n#weak Some Freys tend to become [GetTrait('ambitious').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]"
FREY_TRIDENT_TOLL_COLLECTORS:0 "House Frey hails from the keep of [GetTitleByKey('c_arganbrook').GetNameNoTier], a fortified seat situated on the western bank of the Green Fork. Their newest seat, known colloquially as [GetTitleByKey('c_the_twins').GetNameNoTier], occupies as an incredibly strategic position as a major crossing across the Trident. From this position, House Frey exacts toll on any and all that would seek to use their fortified bridge, and as such they have become incredibly wealthy and opulent, surpassing even the Tullys of Riverrun.\n#weak Some Freys tend to become [GetTrait('greedy').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]. "
FREY_CRANNOGMAN_RIVALRY:0 "House Frey's deep hatred for their Crannogman neighbours to the north is well-documented. Often referring to them as 'frog-eaters' or 'mud-men', the hatred has become instiutionalised among the Frey coterie. For this reason, the majority of House Frey's martial endeavours are centered around this anti-Crannogman dogma."
FREY_PLANS_OF_OUR_OWN:0 "House Frey has risen to such stature that they have far surpassed the wealth of and claim dominion over larger lands than their liege lords. The house can marshal more men than almost any other house in the Riverlands, surpassed only by the Mallisters of Seagard to the west. For this reason, the rulers of House Frey often find themselves taking any stance they can to further their own position within the realm.\n#weak Some Freys tend to become [GetTrait('deceitful').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]."

strong_legacy_3_name: "Stewards of Harrenhal"
strong_legacy_4_name: "Ear of the Crown"
strong_legacy_5_name: "Power Among the Rivers"

STRONG_EPONYMOUS_PHYSIQUES:0 "House Strong is an old and storied house of the Riverlands, often boasting of their First Men descent. This First Men blood runs thick through their veins, and has blessed many a Strong lord with a robust and powerful physique. Ser [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('Strong_30').GetFirstName] Strong was often regarded as the most physically imposing and strongest knight in the Seven Kingdoms, and this reputation precedes and succeeds even him.\n#weak Some Strongs tend to become [GetTrait('strong').GetName( GetNullCharacter )] or [GetTrait('physique_good_2').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]."
STRONG_A_HOUSE_OF_HANDS:0 "House Strong has a legacy of proud and loyal servitude to the Crown, and many of its members have had the honour of serving as Hand of the King. The most legendary example was Lord [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('Strong_7').GetFirstName] Strong, the Hand to King [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('Targaryen_27').GetFirstName] I, 'the Conqueror'. Lord-Hand Osmund was the man responsible for the construction of the walls around King's Landing, and surely many more Strong lords are destined to continue his legacy of loyal and diligent servitude.\n#weak Some Strongs tend to become [GetTrait('loyal').GetName( GetNullCharacter )] or [GetTrait('diligent').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]."
STRONG_STEWARDS_OF_HARRENHAL:0 "To many, receiving the Lordship of Harrenhal is as good as a death sentence. House Strong, however, has so far shirked this superstition, and has continued to further their position from their new seat at Harrenhal. As high lords of both the lordship of [GetTitleByKey('d_harrenhal').GetNameNoTier] and the [GetTitleByKey('d_three_forks').GetNameNoTier], House Strong maintains a position as the most powerful bannerman to House Tully. This position does not come without its drawbacks, however. Harrenhal is still in disrepair, even with the reconstruction efforts of its various lords, and repair projects are incredibly costly, both in gold and sanity."
STRONG_EAR_OF_THE_CROWN:0 "Due to their regional power and their reputation as loyal and competent servants, House Strong often finds itself in very good graces with the monarchs of King's Landing. In recent times, it has become a very rare sight to see a Small Council named without a sitting Lord Strong, and an even rarer sight to find a king without a Strong advisor somewhere amongst his court. For this reason, it is very simple for the lords of Harrenhal to influence realm politics, and even easier to manipulate the decisionmaking of the presiding kings and queens."
STRONG_POWER_AMONG_THE_RIVERS:0 "Due to their huge domains and densely-populated lands, House Strong is able to marshal an incredibly large army, and posture it among the sprawling grounds of Harrenhal."

GRACEFORD_WORK_HER_WILL:0 "The Mother is one of the seven aspects of the Faith of the Seven, and represents mercy, peace, fertility and childbirth.

GRACEFORD_GREAT_SEPTS_OF_HOLYHALL:0 "House Graceford are the builders and keepers of the Great Sept at Holyhall, one of the largest septs in the Seven Kingdoms. The sept is a frequent target for pilgrimages, and many lords, clergymen and travellers pay patronage to its marble walls."
GRACEFORD_LORDS_OF_PEACE_AND_PROSPERITY:0 "House Graceford is not a martial nor subversive house, and yet the house remains strong, navigating skilfully through many troubled times. Dutifully adherent to their faith and its teachings, the house often remains a safe patron for all acolytes of the Seven, and as such, their lands prosper in peace.\n#weak Some Gracefords tend to become [GetTrait('content').GetName( GetNullCharacter )] or [GetTrait('humble').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]."

MALLISTER_PROUD_LINEAGE:0 "House Mallister claims an even prouder and more storied lineage than their Riverman peers or their Tully overlords. Their indigo cloaks and winged helms are noted across many chapters in many history books, and their great deeds of martial ingenuity and supremacy are well-documented.\n#weak Some Mallisters tend to become [GetTrait('brave').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]."
MALLISTER_HARDER_THAN_IRON:0 "The [GetTitleByKey('d_cape_of_eagles').GetNameNoTier], current lordship of House Mallister, was historically ruled by the ironborn. The Mallisters conquered the territory from King Torgon Greyiron of the Isles, and have managed to maintain their conquered lands for the centuries since. To this day, the Mallisters frequently find themselves at odds with the Ironborn, and frequently have they thrown them back into the sea."
MALLISTER_DEFENDERS_OF_SEAGARD:0 "House Mallister rules over the significant walled city of [GetTitleByKey('c_seagard').GetNameNoTier], the third largest city in the Riverlands, behind Fairmarket and Maidenpool. As its protectors and lords, the Mallisters maintain strong relationships with its people and masters, and their subjects are rightfully loyal in kind."
MALLISTER_EAGLE_BLAZONED_WARRIORS:0 "May the Seven give their blessing to any warrior unfortunate enough to face a man draped in indigo."
MALLISTER_LEGACY_OF_DEFIANCE:0 "Ironborn reavers. Storm Kings. Crannogman raiders. Andal invaders. All have fallen at the end of Mallister spears.

OAKHEART_FIRST_MEN_ORIGINS:0 "House Oakheart claims a distant and deeply rooted First Men ancestry, with their progenitor a son of the legendary Garth Greenhand."
OAKHEART_SIRED_ON_GIANTESSES:0 "The founder of House Oakheart, the mythical John the Oak, was said to be sired on a Giantess of the Reach by Garth Greenhand. While mostly regarded as folklore or oral tradition, the robust build and large frames of Oakheart warriors certainly lend some credibility to such a theory...\n#weak Some Oakhearts tend to become [GetTrait('giant').GetName( GetNullCharacter )] or [GetTrait('strong').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]."
OAKHEART_GARDENER_MARSHALS:0 "House Oakheart has a storied history of martial mastery. Under the Gardener Kings, the position of Grand Marshal was oftentimes occupied by an Oakheart lord, even until the very end, when the Oakhearts led the left flank during the fateful Field of Fire."
OAKHEART_UNYIELDING_AS_THE_OAK:0 "Members of House Oakheart are commonly compared to the old oaks from which they hail, often described as stubborn, unwavering, or dogmatic.

PEAKE_LEGACY_OF_FLORYS_THE_FOX:0 "Like Houses Florent and Ball, House Peake's founder is said to be descended from one of the husbands of the legendary Florys the Fox, the conniving and shrewd daughter of Garth Greenhand.

PEAKE_VICTORS_OF_THE_ANCIENT_RIVALRY:0 "The dynastic feud between House Peake and House Manderly is the most famous and well-documented among any in the Seven Kingdoms, including those of the Marcher lords of the Red Mountains.

CONNINGTON_GRIFFIN_TO_WIN_IT:0 "House Connington under the Targaryen regime was an incredibly powerful house, marshalling the most men in the Stormlands and accruing wealth comparable even to House Tarth.

CONNINGTON_OUT_FOR_BLOOD:0 "Though not marcher lords by culture or tradition, the history of House Connington is not too unlike that of those along the Stoneway or Prince's Pass.

KENNING_LEGACY_OF_HERROCK_KENNING:0 "House Kenning of Kayce was founded in a peculiar way. The house was first born when [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('KenningK_4').GetFirstName] Kenning, an ironborn warrior from the island of [GetTitleByKey('d_harlaw').GetNameNoTier], took the town of Kayce not for the kings of salt and sea, but for the King of the Rock.

KENNING_BRUTAL_HISTORY:0 "Like all ironborn, House Kenning of Kayce's lineage have partaken in many particularly brutal excursions, serving in many raids. Unlike most ironborn however, these raids were in the name of the Kingdom of the Rock, not the captains, lords or kings of the Iron Isles. For this reason, House Kenning has developed a unique aptitude for raiding amongst its Westerman allies.\n#weak Some Kennings tend to become [GetTrait('wrathful').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]."
KENNING_LOYAL_TO_THE_ROCK:0 "After forsaking their previous Ironborn overlords, House Kenning of Kayce has been wholly loyal to the kings, and now lords, of [GetTitleByKey('c_casterly_rock').GetNameNoTier], and no Kenning has yet forsaken these new vows.\n#weak Some Kennings tend to become [GetTrait('loyal').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]."
KENNING_BLOOD_OF_BLACK_AND_GOLD_ALIKE:0 "A unique mixture of Ironborn brutality and Westerman acumen, the members of House Kenning of Kayce are truly unique among the other Westerosi mainlanders, and as such, they benefit from the best of both cultures."

HARLAW_RICHEST_OF_THE_POOR:0 "Iron Islanders are not known for their wealth; at least not what they obtain through their own means. House Harlaw has often been an outlier in that regard.
